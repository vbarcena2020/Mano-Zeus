## About

This project is made by the association of RoboTech from the Rey Juan Carlos University, in Madrid, Spain.

The main idea behind this project is inspired on the InMoov project, but we are only going to make a simplyfied solution of the hand part described on the original project.

Take a look to the original project:

- [InMoov's project](https://inmoov.fr/).

## Mechanics

The hand is made out of 3D printed parts. You can find those parts as well as files for construction in the [3D model section](3D_model).

And a list of the progress of impresion in the [3D Model List](Doc/3D_Model_List.md).

The main PCB is in charge of controlling all the peripherals of the robot. You can see in the pictures a all the connectors available. Several modules were provided:

- NEO6VM - GPS
- GY91 - IMU + Compass + Barometer + Temperature sensor
- ESP07 - Wifi module
- TB6612FGN - Dual full H bridge.

At the bottom there are 4 SMPS modules installed. They are capable of delivering up to 5A per channel.

The PCB was designed with Kicad. Take a look to the [PCB section](./noah-hardware\Doc\PCB).
